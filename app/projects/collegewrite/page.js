                A delve into AI research  and its overwhelming presence today.<br/>
                <br/>
                <strong className="flex text-3xl">Background</strong>
                Since I learned programming existed once I had crossed  ten years of age, I have always wanted<br/>
                to create something that could create its own decision. It always seemed so boring solving what was<br/> 
                already solved, creating that which inconceivable amounts of scholars have done better already. The<br/> 
                concept of attempting the creation of a brain, ergo coding an Artificial Intelligence, creates a sense of<br/> 
                individuality upon your code, where everyone&apos;s created model has learned in its own unique way. In my<br/> 
                experience, being able to watch something you create find solutions for a problem that you did not<br/> 
                expressly solve is much more fulfilling.<br/>
                <br/>
                In recent years, it almost seems like talks of dangerously accurate Artificial Intelligence have<br/> 
                sprouted from naught. Unbeknownst to the average civilian, the Machine Learning field has been growing<br/> 
                ever so fast. Stanford University&apos;s 2022 Artificial Intelligence Index Report records an increase in total<br/> 
                global Artificial Intelligence investment from twelve billion 12.75 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 to 91.9 billion<br/> 
                in 2022.While 12.75 billion is no small feat, this level of attention from corporations still fell under the radar<br/> 
                of the general public. Evidently, Artificial Intelligence has remained a very relevant field for longer than<br/> 
                known.<br/>
                <br/>
                The use of Artificial Intelligence in case of solving theoreticals and or on a small scale does not<br/> 
                seem to cause much harm. The catch comes with the use of Artificial Intelligence within places of<br/> 
                unprecedented danger. Whenever an AI is used to make decisions, there is a chance that danger could<br/> 
                come into play. Coluw 74, Issue 3 of Stephen C. Siota and colleagues&apos; <i>Artificial Intelligence and Work</i><br/> 
                considers “the responsibility that creators of AI (including computational models) have toward those who<br/> 
                might be affected by those systems as professionals”, systems as in creations like a driverless car. Who is<br/> 
                at fault if a driverless car chooses to hit someone?<br/>
